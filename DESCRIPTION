Description: Special procedures for the imputation of missing fuzzy numbers are still underdeveloped. The goal of the package is to provide the new d-imputation method (DIMP for short, Romaniuk, M. and Grzegorzewski, P. "Fuzzy Data Imputation with DIMP and FGAIN" RB/23/2023 (2023)) and covert some classical ones applied in R packages ('missForest','miceRanger','knn') for use with fuzzy datasets. Additionally, specially tailored benchmarking tests are provided to check and compare these imputation procedures with fuzzy datasets.
