# FuzzyImputationTest

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of FuzzyImputationTest is to impute (i.e., replace missing values given by NAs) dataset that
consists of triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers and check quality of such an imputation.
To impute fuzzy values, various imputation methods - both general (like miceRanger, missingForest, VIM),
and specific ones (DIMP) - are used.
To check the quality of the imputation process, the dataset without missing values can be used, and then
it is tested with the whole pack of procedures.
These procedures are related to calculation of statistics like the mean, standard deviation, and distance 
measures for fuzzy numbers, together with obtaining different error values, and conduction of statistical
tests based on the epistemic bootstrap.


## Installation

You can install the development version of FuzzyImputationTest from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:



## Example



What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.



In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
